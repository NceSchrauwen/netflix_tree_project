This is currently a project that I am completing to pass a 'BP' project at my current place of study. 
It's a console application that right now that takes one random entry (movie/show) and that will base its information from that together with information gathered by the user's preference and that will generate an X amount of suggestions via binary tree logic. 

Instead of basing it on one random sample in the future the user will pick its own entry and work just the same, it will also be able to provide feedback on the recommendations they were given.
That way a score is being kept and via a low-level machine learning way will the results be customized to the user's own past preference.

Please keep in mind this is a work in progress and will keep being updated until the project is handed in and graded.
